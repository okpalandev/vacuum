# Vacuum

### A numerical computation library for  gmae development.

### Desgined for building games ,vacuum.lua is a numerical computation library for Lua.It is designed to be a lightweight library to be  for physics manipulation within game development.

### Vacuum is inspired by the concepts of vacuums with physics.

## Features
1) Vector(2D,3D,4D) for vector manipulation
2) Matrix(2D,3D,4D) for linear algebra
3) Quaternion for 3D rotation


## Installation

### LuaRocks
```bash
luarocks install vacuum
```

### Manual
```bash
git clone https://github.com/magicmannna/vacuum
cd vacuum
luarocks make
```

## Usage
```lua
local vec2 = require("vacuum.vector.vec2")
local v1 = vec2:new(1,2)
local v2 = vec2:new(3,4)

local v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3.x,v3.y) -- 4 6

```
